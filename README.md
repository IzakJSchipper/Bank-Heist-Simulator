## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Crew**:
   - **Smart Guy (Hacker)**: Master of hacking the security system. The Hacker's skills are crucial for bypassing any tech challenges.
   - **Strong Guy**: The muscle of the crew, able to handle heavy lifting, intimidation, and ensuring the heist runs smoothly on the ground.
   - **Fast Guy**: Quick on their feet, ensuring swift escapes from the scene with minimal delay.

2. **Distribute the Loot**: After the heist, you will divide the stolen money based on the crew's skills and contributions. Each crew member has a skill level, which will influence their share. For instance, a higher hack level for the Smart Guy means they get a larger cut of the cash.

3. **Ensure No One Gets More Than Their Fair Share**: The total split must not exceed 100%. Make sure the percentages you allocate add up to 100%—if not, the heist might not work out as planned.

4. **The Heist Continues**: Plan your crew’s actions carefully, and remember, each choice you make can impact the success of the heist.
